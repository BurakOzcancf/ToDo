## Overview

### What is the goal of this project?

I've made this project to make practice React.js skills and to build a project. So why the ToDo app? Because building a todo app is really useful to improve how to deal with useState and forms. The Todo app already is a well-known basic app.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See current date and time
- Add new item to ToDo list
- Dynamic greetings in order to time
- Edit the item which added
- Delete the item which added
- Filter the items in order to completed and active
- Clear completed and all
